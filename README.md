# infinite_addmul
Adding and multiplying two infinite(very very large) integer numbers in python.

Both addition and multiplication is done with using loop and recursion. Each number is represented as a list and the lists are made of nodes, where each nodes have fixed number of digits [4 for this code]. The nodes of the two lists are then added using the sum/carry addition method. For multiplication, each digit of second number is multiplied with the first number and added all of them together to get the multiplication value.
